        <h1>NOFX</h1>

        <h2>Stand By Me</h2>

        <p>When the night has come<br>
            And the land is dark<br>
            And the moon is the only light we'll see<br>
            Well, I won't be afraid<br>
            No, I won't be afraid<br>
            Just as long as you stand<br>
            Stand by me</p>

        <p>So darling, darling,<br>
            Stand by me,<br>
            Won't you stand by me<br>
            Just as long as you stand,<br>
            Stand by me</p>

        <p>When the sky that we look upon<br>
            tumble and fall<br>
            And the mountains crumble to the sea<br>
            I won't cry, I won't cry,<br>
            No, I won't shed a tear<br>
            Just as long as you stand<br>
            Stand by me</p>

        <p>So darling, darling,<br>
            Stand by me,<br>
            Oh won't you stand by me<br>
            Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand<br>
            Stand by me<br>
            Darling, darling,<br>
            Stand by me,<br>
            Oh won't you, stand by me<br>
            Oh won't you stand, oh won't you stand<br>
            Stand by me</p>

        <P>When the night has come<br>
            And the land is dark<br>
            And the moon is the only light we'll see<br>
            I won't cry, No I won't cry,<br>
            No, I won't shed a tear<br>
            Just as long as you fucking stand by me</P>
